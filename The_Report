# Name, Grade and Mark. 
#Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first.

select 
case when grade >= 8 then name
else null end as student_name,  grade, marks
from
(select  name, marks, ceil(marks/10) as grade
from Students  ) as t1
order by grade desc, name, marks;
